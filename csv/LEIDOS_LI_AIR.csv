197,Arturo Gonzalez,San Francisco Bay Area,"""The California Business Roundtable released a statewide survey of 1,142 businesses throughout the state, reporting their perspectives on California's business climate. According to the survey, sixty-nine percent (69%) of businesses say it's harder to do business in California than in other states.

Throughout the years, California has turned relentlessly anti-business. Regulations change so often that it's difficult for companies to stay compliant. The business environment is notoriously labeled as toxic, and new companies are constantly being told to stay away. It's a story we know all too well: a local business shuts their door and leaves town because they can't afford to stay in the state. This mass exodus of jobs leaving California is unacceptable. Californians deserve better.""

The statement above was taken from an article published in the Sacramento Bee and I agree with its sentiments. To make the regulatory environment less onerous, in part, permits should be crafted to provide applicant(s)/permittee(s) with the maximum flexibility required to respond to real time changes in consumer demands and still remain in compliance with rules and regulations. Potential liabilities on a permit should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. Permits should not unnecessarily put a straight jacket on operations. Although permits can be modified to address process modifications a business may need to respond to a customer the same day regarding an order and/or contract agreement.","Leidos’ contractor.
