,Arturo,Gonzalez,"""The California Business Roundtable released a statewide survey of 1,142 businesses throughout the state, reporting their perspectives on California's business climate. According to the survey, sixty-nine percent (69%) of businesses say it's harder to do business in California than in other states.

Throughout the years, California has turned relentlessly anti-business. Regulations change so often that it's difficult for companies to stay compliant. The business environment is notoriously labeled as toxic, and new companies are constantly being told to stay away. It's a story we know all too well: a local business shuts their door and leaves town because they can't afford to stay in the state. This mass exodus of jobs leaving California is unacceptable. Californians deserve better.""

The statement above was taken from an article published in the Sacramento Bee and I agree with its sentiments. To make the regulatory environment less onerous, in part, permits should be crafted to provide applicant(s)/permittee(s) with the maximum flexibility required to respond to real time changes in consumer demands and still remain in compliance with rules and regulations. Potential liabilities on a permit should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. Permits should not unnecessarily put a straight jacket on operations.

,Christopher,Woodring,"On a 3 mile run at Parris Island, Marine Corps Bootcamp, I had fallen behind, I was tired and my legs were sore, I just wanted to quit. My Drill Instructor, from the front of the formation, turned himself around to check on me since Marines leave no man behind.

He saw that I was aching and in pain, he can tell by my face I wanted to quit. He got a hold of my shoulder and told me ""You must not quit, even when your tired and sore and everything has gone to hell, you must never give up.""

I didn't give up that day and from that day, I never have. I bring that mentality of determination and perseverance to all aspects of my life. Whether work or school, I do not give up, I keep going despite what might seem like daunting tasks and unfavorable odds, I succeed.

With that mentality, I have gained numerous skills such as the ArcDesktop suite, Adobe suite, cartographic designs and principles. With that mentality, I also pursue new and improved skills to make me more efficient and versatile to the work environment and a team.

,Joe,Robinson,"Mission Statement – I want to tackle the most challenging projects out there. The impossible is the most exciting project to work. I’ll help every member of the team perform better than they have ever performed before and turn them all into superstars.

I had a realization that the greatest innovations I’ve witnessed in my 35 year career in air/hypersonic defense operations research and missile development were done by me.
The G-sec evaluation paradigm and the latency equation make Ops Research simple and fast. The recoverable missile paradigm changes missile testing from a few times a year proposition to not much harder than UAV testing. It also means missiles can fly CAPs.

I've been on three teams in my career that were declared ""once in a lifetime"" at the time. What made them so.... incredible performance/output, egos were muted, comradery. I'm either the luckiest guy in the world or I played a critical role in these ""once in a lifetime"" teams.

I'm incredibly product focused but products were made to serve people, so if humans become less human by making them then they are counterproductive. So a balance has to be made where productivity is high but people are served.

I'm very curious, so when I work a project I usually end up understanding ever aspect of it. That's likely why I became the best chief engineer I've ever seen on a recent project.

,Kyle,Cox,"Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering has always been my passion and that's why I attended one of the best colleges that can offer just that (Ramblin' Wreck baby!). I always enjoy the challenge and complexity that engineering has to offer - it makes the time worth it and being apart of team of the same passion makes it even better. For the last 5 years, I have had the pleasure of creating my own mechanical systems designs and seeing them applied to automotive manufacturing in a big way.

I absolutely love airplanes and even get to fly gas powered RC airplanes from time to time. The creativity that has developed them over the last 100 years blows me away and it made it even better to hear my grandfather tell me stories of the air force in Korea when I was a kid. Nothing beats that loud roar of a F-15 as it sails overhead!

Outside of the busy work place, I enjoy golfing whenever I can and taking care of my home life. I love to cook and watch football during the fall, especially football Saturdays. You can always rely on me to have wings and burgers on the grill during those great times!

I enjoy meeting new people and hope to find some great connections on this site. Feel free to drop a message, I'm always open!

,Michael,DiGesu,"I am a senior analyst with significant experience aligning teams to thrive under the most tense conditions. I've had the opportunity to interface and collaborate with internal and external stakeholders to ensure everyone from engineers to financial analysts are on the same page and work together to accomplish the mission.

Roughly ten years of military training has taught me to be a ""Jack of all trades,"" while becoming a master of managing people and situations. Over the past 10 years I have sailed halfway across the globe on a US Navy warship, worked as a budget analyst for a $18 billion major defense acquisition program, and managed the life cycle support and sustainment for a US Navy weapon system. I've learned in my time that while each stakeholder has a unique objective, we all are ultimately pursuing the same goal to meet the organization's mission requirements. I pride myself on being able to unify people and create a passion to work together so everyone succeeds.

I'm now looking to pursue my next adventure outside the military. I am proficient in Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Powerpoint, Sharepoint, and Visio), and SAP ERP. I have an extensive understanding of supply chain management, procurement, sustainment, budget execution, and I am exceptionally skilled at giving presentations to leadership. However, I am most passionate about working with people, identifying deficiencies, and galvanizing the team to get the job done.

Outside work I enjoy spending time with my family, travelling, and discussing health and fitness with my wife.","Keller, Texas, United States",Senior Analyst,"Senior analyst managing a greater than $50 million contract imperative to providing comprehensive logistics and sustainment planning.

My extensive performing background has made me very outgoing and excellent at interacting with people. I thrive in new situations and with new challenges. The past ten years, I have held sales positions with varying responsibilities that include ordering custom pieces, brand training, being a sales leader, and was chosen as a designer brand ambassador. I exceeded monthly sales of senior coworkers and helped the store to raise the gross
margin by 15%. Due to the nature of the luxury jewelry industry, accuracy and attention to details are paramount.

The position I enjoyed most and thrived in was as an auditor of 13 dealerships in the southeast as well as learning all of the roles of the accounting controller and office manager. I held the responsibility of managing the accounts of the dealership as well as payroll, HR, warranties, G/L accounts, payable and receivable accounts, paying monthly and quarterly sales tax among many other things.

,Stephen,Galik,"Currently, I am an employee of Dynetics, Inc. in Huntsville, AL. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology.

I started my professional life as a vehicle maintenance technician, in the USAF. Working on mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic systems has given me the hands on experience to know what will work, and what will not work, in the design phase. My military experience as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force has taught me how to lead and make hard decisions in high-pressure situations.

In college, I was determined to get as much hands on engineering experience as I could. I spent three years of my after school hours working on SDSMT'S Formula SAE car team and learned about component and system design and composites fabrication. My senior year of after school time was spent forming SDSMT's first rocket team and designed and built a new kind of hybrid rocket engine. My final two years were also spent working for Zyvex Technologies fabricating and testing composites and adhesives.

While working at XCOR, I honed my time management skills and acquired engineering experience with composite structures, and mechanical systems, design and fabrication. I also acquired knowledge about supersonic vehicle design and liquid rocket engine system design.

While working at CSI Compressco, I've learned how to work with customers, vendors, and design to ensure the customer gets what they want and in a tinely manner. Learning to orchestrate parts to arrive just in time for package fabrication has been critical to success.","Harvest, Alabama, United States",Mechanical Engineer,,USAF,,,,

,Tyler,Ross,"I believe that with an intelligent approach, hard work, and a good attitude, anything is possible. I've used this philosophy to graduate at the top of my class with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Auburn University, guided me through my graduate studies, and has guided me through my early career.

As an undergraduate, I worked for both Alabama Power and Rheem Manufacturing Company, which gave me good experience in two drastically different environments. At Alabama Power; the job was mostly on outdoor projects, while at Rheem, the job was based out of a plant. As part of my senior design project, I contributed to the design and construction of AubieSat-2 (the Auburn University 3U CubeSat). This project greatly enhanced my interests in the challenges of space flight and designing mechanisms that will be able to sustain launch conditions and work in the harsh environments of space.

Throughout my studies, my interests have ranged from the dynamic simulations of complex systems to solve difficult problems, such as modeling the behavior of highly nonlinear shape memory alloys or predicting the wear rate of two surfaces in contact over long periods of time. I've also been interested and done research into the 3D printing of various materials in order to make objects such as silicone masks for turbine blades, capacitors, and compliant mechanisms.

However, my most primary interest comes from my childhood where I fell in love with computer programming and made video games as a hobby. As a mechanical engineer, this naturally lent itself to an interest in embedded systems and autonomous control problems as well as simulation. On top of the design and programming of autonomous systems, my early career has featured many tasks exploring complex problems involving dynamic mixing and phase change within a CFD framework as well as creating detailed thermodynamic models suited for a variety of applications (i.e. a blast-rated custom-made heat flux sensor)","Huntsville, Alabama, United States",ISSO,,USAF,,,,
