San Francisco Bay Area,"""The California Business Roundtable released a statewide survey of 1,142 businesses throughout the state, reporting their perspectives on California's business climate. According to the survey, sixty-nine percent (69%) of businesses say it's harder to do business in California than in other states.

Throughout the years, California has turned relentlessly anti-business. Regulations change so often that it's difficult for companies to stay compliant. The business environment is notoriously labeled as toxic, and new companies are constantly being told to stay away. It's a story we know all too well: a local business shuts their door and leaves town because they can't afford to stay in the state. This mass exodus of jobs leaving California is unacceptable. Californians deserve better.""

The statement above was taken from an article published in the Sacramento Bee and I agree with its sentiments. To make the regulatory environment less onerous, in part, permits should be crafted to provide applicant(s)/permittee(s) with the maximum flexibility required to respond to real time changes in consumer demands and still remain in compliance with rules and regulations. Potential liabilities on a permit should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. Permits should not unnecessarily put a straight jacket on operations.

"Brookeville, Maryland, United States","On a 3 mile run at Parris Island, Marine Corps Bootcamp, I had fallen behind, I was tired and my legs were sore, I just wanted to quit. My Drill Instructor, from the front of the formation, turned himself around to check on me since Marines leave no man behind.

He saw that I was aching and in pain, he can tell by my face I wanted to quit. He got a hold of my shoulder and told me ""You must not quit, even when your tired and sore and everything has gone to hell, you must never give up.""

I didn't give up that day and from that day, I never have. I bring that mentality of determination and perseverance to all aspects of my life. Whether work or school, I do not give up, I keep going despite what might seem like daunting tasks and unfavorable odds, I succeed.

With that mentality, I have gained numerous skills such as the ArcDesktop suite, Adobe suite, cartographic designs and principles.

Greater Tampa Bay Area,"I do my best to hold true to the mantra, “I can and I will and I will always strive to do it exceptionally well.” Throughout my career, this belief and positive attitude has enabled me to not only achieve success, but to motivate and lead others to fulfill their goals. I have lived by a saying, “show me your friends and I’ll show you your future.” This statement my father told me as a young man, has always been a motivating factor of not getting with the wrong crowd. I believe if you surround yourself with successful people then that success will follow you. I am proud of my ability to communicate with others, my listening skills and most of all to have empathy towards others. This I believe, has more impact than just “knowing” a job.

With my background, I provided services for numerous government clients that included the U.S. State Department, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and other government agencies.

I have extensive experience managing critical tactical operations both domestically and abroad. If a situation arises I can remain calm in highly stressful situations and make strategic split-second decisions to ensure the safety of those around me and am able to complete what needs to be done in a timely manner.

My areas of proficiency are client and governmental relations, tactical operations management, quality control, configuration analysis, strategic planning and analysis, communications systems, conflict resolution, air traffic control, flight management, and flight systems.
