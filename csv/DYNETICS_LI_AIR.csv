I always enjoy the challenge and complexity that engineering has to offer - it makes the time worth it and being apart of team of the same passion makes it even better. For the last 5 years, I have had the pleasure of creating my own mechanical systems designs and seeing them applied to automotive manufacturing in a big way.

I absolutely love airplanes and even get to fly gas powered RC airplanes from time to time. The creativity that has developed them over the last 100 years blows me away and it made it even better to hear my grandfather tell me stories of the air force in Korea when I was a kid. Nothing beats that loud roar of a F-15 as it sails overhead!

Outside of the busy work place, I enjoy golfing whenever I can and taking care of my home life. I love to cook and watch football during the fall, especially football Saturdays. You can always rely on me to have wings and burgers on the grill during those great times!

I enjoy meeting new people and hope to find some great connections on this site. Feel free to drop a message, I'm always open!

Working on mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic systems has given me the hands on experience to know what will work, and what will not work, in the design phase. My military experience as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force has taught me how to lead and make hard decisions in high-pressure situations.

In college, I was determined to get as much hands on engineering experience as I could. I spent three years of my after school hours working on SDSMT'S Formula SAE car team and learned about component and system design and composites fabrication. My senior year of after school time was spent forming SDSMT's first rocket team and designed and built a new kind of hybrid rocket engine. My final two years were also spent working for Zyvex Technologies fabricating and testing composites and adhesives.

While working at XCOR, I honed my time management skills and acquired engineering experience with composite structures, and mechanical systems, design and fabrication. I also acquired knowledge about supersonic vehicle design and liquid rocket engine system design.

While working at CSI Compressco, I've learned how to work with customers, vendors, and design to ensure the customer gets what they want and in a tinely manner.

138,Tyler Ross Lambert,"I believe that with an intelligent approach, hard work, and a good attitude, anything is possible. I've used this philosophy to graduate at the top of my class with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Auburn University, guided me through my graduate studies, and has guided me through my early career.

As an undergraduate, I worked for both Alabama Power and Rheem Manufacturing Company, which gave me good experience in two drastically different environments. At Alabama Power; the job was mostly on outdoor projects, while at Rheem, the job was based out of a plant. As part of my senior design project, I contributed to the design and construction of AubieSat-2 (the Auburn University 3U CubeSat). This project greatly enhanced my interests in the challenges of space flight and designing mechanisms that will be able to sustain launch conditions and work in the harsh environments of space.

Throughout my studies, my interests have ranged from the dynamic simulations of complex systems to solve difficult problems, such as modeling the behavior of highly nonlinear shape memory alloys or predicting the wear rate of two surfaces in contact over long periods of time. I've also been interested and done research into the 3D printing of various materials in order to make objects such as silicone masks for turbine blades, capacitors, and compliant mechanisms.

However, my most primary interest comes from my childhood where I fell in love with computer programming and made video games as a hobby. As a mechanical engineer, this naturally lent itself to an interest in embedded systems and autonomous control problems as well as simulation. On top of the design and programming of autonomous systems, my early career has featured many tasks exploring complex problems involving dynamic mixing and phase change within a CFD framework as well as creating detailed thermodynamic models suited for a variety of applications (i.e. a blast-rated custom-made heat flux sensor)","Huntsville, Alabama, United States",ISSO,

I had a realization that the greatest innovations I’ve witnessed in my 35 year career in air/hypersonic defense operations research and missile development were done by me.
The G-sec evaluation paradigm and the latency equation make Ops Research simple and fast. The recoverable missile paradigm changes missile testing from a few times a year proposition to not much harder than UAV testing. It also means missiles can fly CAPs.

I've been on three teams in my career that were declared ""once in a lifetime"" at the time. What made them so.... incredible performance/output, egos were muted, comradery. I'm either the luckiest guy in the world or I played a critical role in these ""once in a lifetime"" teams.

I'm incredibly product focused but products were made to serve people, so if humans become less human by making them then they are counterproductive. So a balance has to be made where productivity is high but people are served.

I'm very curious, so when I work a project I usually end up understanding ever aspect of it. That's likely why I became the best chief engineer I've ever seen on a recent project.

210,Tim Pickens,"I've dedicated my career to developing and delivering hardware solutions to facilitate affordable and responsive space access. I am an inventor, engineer, entrepreneur, innovator, and designer, primarily focused on aerospace solutions. I provide consulting services as a subject matter expert in commercial aerospace, propulsion, and product commercialization. I have served as a SME on hybrid and liquid propulsion systems and have done extensive work on valve design and repair.

I apply lean philosophies to develop creative solutions and innovative partnerships to provide responsive, low-cost products and services. I have 25-plus years of experience in the aerospace industry, specializing in the design, fabrication, and testing of propulsion hardware systems. I have designed liquid and hybrid rocket motors ranging from five to 375,000 pounds of thrust; led composite component design and manufacturing of rocket motor cases, nozzles, tanks, and other vehicle components; designed and constructed multiple test set-ups involving the use of advanced instrumentation, signal conditioning and data acquisition-related electronics; and designed and constructed rocket fluid control electronics, as well as specialized prototype test equipment and machinery.

I founded Orion Propulsion, a Huntsville aerospace company, in 2004, and sold it to Dynetics in 2009 after growing it to 40 employees and $6.4 million. Orion received multiple Small Business awards and became AS9100-certified to build man-rated flight hardware. Before founding Orion, I was lead propulsion engineer on SpaceShipOne, the $10 million Ansari X Prize winner, and worked for hardware-rich aerospace companies. I have led multiple amateur rocket design efforts.
