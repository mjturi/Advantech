208,Alexander Sudyk,"“You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him discover it in himself.” I learned the importance of this mentality during my time in the Army and still abide by it to this day.

Asking the questions “why” and “how” lead me on the path to a degree in mechanical engineering but my sense of purpose and duty lead me to West Point.

After serving six years, I knew I wanted a new challenge where I could apply my skills in engineering, planning and execution, stakeholder management, team building, conflict resolution, and data analysis. I found that challenge in the form of a commercially facing role at Shell.

Throughout the past few years on the Contracting & Procurement team, I’ve been able to refine those skills while developing others.",Senior Buyer
