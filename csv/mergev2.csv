I enjoy a good data science challenge and am currently working with senior Navy clients to help them establish a chief data officer role to better leverage their disconnected mission critical data and systems across the agency and develop a strategy to obtain more value from their data and move their organization into the future.

In previous roles, I've worked for multiple organizations within Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, leading teams that performed mission-based analytics for critical infrastructure protection by combining massive amounts of data across all infrastructures to achieve mission-based results. These projects, which analyzed large amounts of disparate critical infrastructure data using technologies available at that time, were the precursor to the current big data efforts that focus on using cutting-edge technologies to see data differently and achieve ground breaking solutions.

I am also leading strategic Booz Allen data science investments to help make data science concepts more easily understandable for all staff and enable them to start a data science dialog with their clients. My approach is focused on becoming a force multiplier for data science and propagating it across Booz Allen and external client organizations.
