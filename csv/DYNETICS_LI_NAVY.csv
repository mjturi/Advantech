I co-designed and developed a system that guides drone helicopters to loads that they need to pick up, and have worked on a robotic system to read fingerprints from ten feet away. Past work included design of space sensors to measure location, and smart systems to identify and track objects. I was involved in creating the Advanced Video Guidance Sensor that flew on the DART and Orbital Express missions to measure how far away a spacecraft was.

During my PhD research I was part of a team working to cool a gas of neutral atoms to near absolute zero to investigate superfluidity. This was much cooler than it may sound.

Previously I wrote about adventure games and interactive fiction for About. I have written freelance articles about programming and adventure games for various computer magazines.

Roughly ten years of military training has taught me to be a ""Jack of all trades,"" while becoming a master of managing people and situations. Over the past 10 years I have sailed halfway across the globe on a US Navy warship, worked as a budget analyst for a $18 billion major defense acquisition program, and managed the life cycle support and sustainment for a US Navy weapon system.

I have an extensive understanding of supply chain management, procurement, sustainment, budget execution, and I am exceptionally skilled at giving presentations to leadership.
