I am a recent graduate of the Master's in Robotic System Development program at Carnegie-Mellon University. My work at CMU focused on designing and prototyping prosthetics which enhance rather than replace human capabilities and I did several of my final projects on the topic of non-symbolic communication - using brain and muscle interfaces. I am a technical generalist, having worked on autonomy, vision, perception, embedded software, motor control, fabrication, and electrical design. My experience and education were in project and product management; I learned how to manage big projects at the Navy using Waterfall and Spiral frameworks and Agile ones at Carnegie Mellon using Scrum and Kanban. I gained my expertise in Model Based Systems Engineering in my work for the Navy and for L3Harris Corporation, where I was modeler for a model-centric project that made ~10:1 ROI with 700k of revenue.

219,Christopher Woodring,"Brookeville, Maryland, United States","On a 3 mile run at Parris Island, Marine Corps Bootcamp, I had fallen behind, I was tired and my legs were sore, I just wanted to quit. My Drill Instructor, from the front of the formation, turned himself around to check on me since Marines leave no man behind.

He saw that I was aching and in pain, he can tell by my face I wanted to quit. He got a hold of my shoulder and told me ""You must not quit, even when your tired and sore and everything has gone to hell, you must never give up.""

I didn't give up that day and from that day, I never have. I bring that mentality of determination and perseverance to all aspects of my life. Whether work or school, I do not give up, I keep going despite what might seem like daunting tasks and unfavorable odds, I succeed.

With that mentality, I have gained numerous skills such as the ArcDesktop suite, Adobe suite, cartographic designs and principles. With that mentality, I also pursue new and improved skills to make me more efficient and versatile to the work environment and a team. JFK once said, ""We do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.""","Title
