,Alexander,Sudyk,,,,,ARMY,,,,"â€œYou cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him discover it in himself.â€ I learned the importance of this mentality during my time in the Army and still abide by it to this day.

Asking the questions â€œwhyâ€ and â€œhowâ€ lead me on the path to a degree in mechanical engineering but my sense of purpose and duty lead me to West Point.

After serving six years, I knew I wanted a new challenge where I could apply my skills in engineering, planning and execution, stakeholder management, team building, conflict resolution, and data analysis. I found that challenge in the form of a commercially facing role at Shell.

According to the survey, sixty-nine percent (69%) of businesses say it's harder to do business in California than in other states.

Throughout the years, California has turned relentlessly anti-business. Regulations change so often that it's difficult for companies to stay compliant. The business environment is notoriously labeled as toxic, and new companies are constantly being told to stay away. It's a story we know all too well: a local business shuts their door and leaves town because they can't afford to stay in the state. This mass exodus of jobs leaving California is unacceptable. Californians deserve better.""

The statement above was taken from an article published in the Sacramento Bee and I agree with its sentiments. To make the regulatory environment less onerous, in part, permits should be crafted to provide applicant(s)/permittee(s) with the maximum flexibility required to respond to real time changes in consumer demands and still remain in compliance with rules and regulations. Potential liabilities on a permit should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. Permits should not unnecessarily put a straight jacket on operations. Although permits can be modified to address process modifications a business may need to respond to a customer the same day regarding an order and/or contract agreement.","Leidos’ contractor.

,Charisse,S.,,,,,USAF,,,,"Years ago I applied for the sheriffâ€™s academy because I was determined to â€œsave the worldâ€. Regardless of how big of an idea or dream I had, I always felt like anything was possible. Yet, as much as I wanted to become a county sheriff, it just didnâ€™t happen for me.

Instead, a different opportunity opened up...one that would change my life forever and satisfy my â€œsave the worldâ€ dream. Instead of serving my county, I decided I wanted to serve my country.

By 2011, I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and gained some of the most memorable experiences of my life. From traveling to Europe, the Middle East and all over the United States, I developed lifelong friendships and professional skills that would eventually give me ample room to grow in my career.

In fact, my career didnâ€™t stop here. It expanded further in 2017, when I deciding to take on a new venture that would reestablish my footing outside of the military. However, since my love for serving didnâ€™t cease at the end of my military contract, I chose to enlist in the Air Force reserves.

Fast forward to today, Iâ€™m now currently working at an esteemed professional consulting firm whoâ€™s values match my own. As a senior consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, Iâ€™ve gained a new sense of accomplishment by joining in the effort to help others with new innovative ideas, problem solving and developing analytic methods for creating the art of the possible.

Working at a talented firm, supporting the Department of Defense and continuing my Military career as an Air Force Reservist, Iâ€™m very proud of my accomplishments and I can only imagine what more life has in store for me.

My combined years of military and consulting experience has increased my capabilities and understanding of the following:

- Cost Estimating
- Acquisitions
- Program policies
- Intermediate data science
- MS Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint
- Professional networking
- Effective communication
- Stakeholder engagement
- Federal passport and visa process
- Relocation counseling
- Military separation and retirement processes
- Working in a diverse community of military branches (U.S. and international)

Iâ€™m always looking for more opportunities to learn and network with colleagues. So please feel free to click â€œConnectâ€.

,Enrique,S.,,,,,USAF,,,,"Currently I am a Senior Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton supporting the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. in Contract Management. I recently served as a Contract Specialist supporting AMIC at the Joint Warfare Analysis Center, and before that I served as a Warranted Contracting Officer/ Team Lead in the Services Flight at Langley AFB, VA doing cradle to grave contracting. I have a DAWIA Level II in Contracting and currently hold a SECRET Clearance. I have experience honing and developing PWS/SOW's and managing the full spectrum of requirements documents. I am a business advisor to my mission partners and a steward of taxpayer dollars.

I began my Air Force career in Civil Engineering as an Operations Manager. My primary focus was work load managing, scheduling, and strategic manpower movements. I worked with vendors and Service Contracts to keep the mission going and leveraged my responsibilities as a COR to get the most efficient use of Government dollars; I was even coined by the Contractors for excellence. I've led projects while deployed to the Middle East and ran contingency control centers across the West Coast. I transitioned to the Acquisitions career field and continue to project manage the full gambit of government requirements; from IT upgrades, Construction, Equipment, etc.

During my military career I have continued to strive for excellence, always aiming to fall in the top 10 percent. My exemplary service includes acheiving Honor Graduate from Basic Training, Distinguished Graduate at Technical School, Distinguished Graduate at Airman Leadership School, and Distinguished Graduate at Non-Commissioned Officer Academy as the only E-5 Staff Sergeant in my class. Among many Squadron and Wing level annual/quarterly awards, I have been awarded two Air Force Achievement medals and one Air Force Commendation medal. I am currently enrolled in Webster University's Masters program in Procurement and Acquisitions Management.

I believe that leadership, rather than a buzzword, is a lifestyle. The little things, done right, will have resounding effects on all those in our immediate work and family lives. Flexing this muscle is the only way to grow it, and in order to impact your community (both professional and local), this habit of growing leadership skills needs to be a persistent one.",Senior Consultant

I have lived by a saying, “show me your friends and I’ll show you your future.” This statement my father told me as a young man, has always been a motivating factor of not getting with the wrong crowd. I believe if you surround yourself with successful people then that success will follow you. I am proud of my ability to communicate with others, my listening skills and most of all to have empathy towards others. This I believe, has more impact than just “knowing” a job.

With my background, I provided services for numerous government clients that included the U.S. State Department, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and other government agencies.

I have extensive experience managing critical tactical operations both domestically and abroad. If a situation arises I can remain calm in highly stressful situations and make strategic split-second decisions to ensure the safety of those around me and am able to complete what needs to be done in a timely manner.

While purposefully flying through dangerous hurricanes with the Hurricane Hunters, as crazy as that seems, was a strong desire, I ended up flying in the mighty B-52. That set me on a path to experience nearly everything on my list and them some. I've been truly blessed.

After years of hard training by extremely talented mentors, the Air Force developed me into an electronic warfare, weapons, and tactics expert. Through combat experience, seeing others I admired make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and some personal experiences, my focus shifted from pursuing egocentric objectives to serving others, especially those who worked for me or relied on me for anything.

As I progressed through my career, I learned to become more forward thinking. I honed the ability to develop a long term vision that solves specific problems, successfully find resources and buy in from leadership, and manage complex projects to achieve my vision. I became exceptionally good at rallying and steering award winning experts towards organizational goals, picking up some process improvement skills along the way.

I have an enduring passion to train and equip current and future generation warfighters for effective combat operations against potential adversaries. I strongly desire to work in positions that allow me to positively influence the ability of our servicemen and women to achieve mission success and return home safely. The Air Force, and those who continue or had the courage to serve, have done more for my family and me than I could ever repay. I will continue to seek ways to pay that back to our young servicemen and women. I look forward to serving them in whatever capacity I can.",EMPTY

I enjoy a good data science challenge and am currently working with senior Navy clients to help them establish a chief data officer role to better leverage their disconnected mission critical data and systems across the agency and develop a strategy to obtain more value from their data and move their organization into the future.

In previous roles, I've worked for multiple organizations within Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, leading teams that performed mission-based analytics for critical infrastructure protection by combining massive amounts of data across all infrastructures to achieve mission-based results. These projects, which analyzed large amounts of disparate critical infrastructure data using technologies available at that time, were the precursor to the current big data efforts that focus on using cutting-edge technologies to see data differently and achieve ground breaking solutions.

I am also leading strategic Booz Allen data science investments to help make data science concepts more easily understandable for all staff and enable them to start a data science dialog with their clients. My approach is focused on becoming a force multiplier for data science and propagating it across Booz Allen and external client organizations.

,Tina,Wyant,,,,,USAF,,,,"For years, my teams and I have been privileged to be a leading ISR impact multipliers. Delivering the right ISR resources and products to the right people faster and cheaper than our competitionâ€”and better than the threatâ€”is what I do best.
Iâ€™m ready to offer the value that comes from extensive experience in all portions of the intelligence process from planning to execution to evaluation and have thrived doing them all.
Of course, analytic and technical currency is crucial to what I do. Discerning actionable intel from mountains of information is where my payoffs and personal rewards come from.
Leading people requires applying the same principles as marshaling information. A taut, seamless organization gives me, as well as all my stakeholders and customers, confidence our products exceed expectations for thoroughness and attention to detail.
One of our finest moments was the deployment of Global Hawk to Afghanistan in support of combat operations 18 months prior to operational acceptance and $10M cheaper than original estimates.
I am happiest when we find the right balance between quality, timeliness and cost to meet customer needs. The operative word in the previous sentence is â€œwe.â€ I love building and leading teams to levels of project success even they didnâ€™t think possible.
That certainly happened when ISR missions doubled at DGS-5 in Hi. Our new architecture not only found and fixed choke points, it increased combat support capacity and helped us secure more annual awards for our airmen than four other Groupsâ€”combined.
The Air Force and intelligence community taught me to guide team members to exploit opportunity exceptionally well. Now I want to put all the wisdom and leadership skill Iâ€™ve develop at the disposal of an organization with the same dedication to ISR I have.
If you fit that description, I encourage you to contact me any time: 703.328.2471, or: tmwyant16@gmail.com.

I seek opportunities to test my problem-solving skills and finding ways to improve my teams as well as myself. Although I have a strong drive and competitiveness, I always consider how my actions may affect others on my team and work to balance efficiency and quality. For 30-years my bottom line has been human capital. My decisions have to take into account the effect on mission accomplishment, the individual and their families.

Iâ€™ve spent a lifetime focusing on successful execution without the luxury of selecting my team. As a military leader I have to find ways to develop the skills in every team member without the ability to change members who do not exhibit capability.

I like to approach new challenges humbly and learn how my talents best fit the organization, Iâ€™m not about changing operations unless change produces a more efficient or effective organization. I believe change just for the sake of change is counter-productive.

Iâ€™m always looking for a winning solution an I take a pragmatic approach in analyzing evidence without falling prey to indecision. Definitely not afraid to make a decision or point out shortcomings in a plan while working towards wining solutions void of emotional biases, even when skeptical on potential drawbacks. Iâ€™m unwilling to compromise my principles, and not afraid to be blunt or insistent even when it means I must face resistance, opposition, or conflict if it means doing what is right for myself, me team, and my organization.
